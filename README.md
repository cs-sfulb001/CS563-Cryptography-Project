# Cryptography Project
To compile the program you need a computer that can run a make and run in the commandline either "make" or "make all"
To run the program, in the commandline enter "Program.exe encrypt/decrypt (file path)" or the linux equivalent. Replace (file path) with the file you desire to encrypt or decrypt.

When the program finishies encrypting, the encrypted file will have the same name in /Encrypted/ and the public key will be in /Keys/. A new set of keys is generated each time the program encrypts a file.

When the program is finished decrypting, the decrypted file will have the same name in /Decrypted/
